This is Image Processing Course Project that apply many filters with  simple GUI:




For the Spatial Domain filters: 


• Smoothing Spatial filters (used for noise reduction): 
o Median filter. 
o Adaptive filter (median, min, or max). 
o Averaging filter. 
o Gaussian filter. 

• Sharpening Spatial filters: 
o Laplacian Operator. 
o Unsharp Masking and Highboost Filtering. 
o Roberts Cross-Gradient Operators. 
o Sobel Operators. 

• Noise filters: 
o Impulse noise (salt and pepper). 
o Gaussian noise. 
o Uniform noise.




For the Transform /Frequency Domain filters: 


• Histogram Equalization. 
• Histogram Specification. 
• Fourier transform (forward and Inverse). 
• Interpolation (nearest neighbor, bilinear, or bicubic).
